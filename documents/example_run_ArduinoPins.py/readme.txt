This is an example run for the system described in ArduinoPins.py

In order for this example to work, analog pins 1,2 should be connected to PWM pins 9,10 respectively, through two low-pass filters.
The low pass filters are simply a resistor (22KOhm) and a capacitor (1uF) connected to ground. Please see screenshots and Fritzing file for exact connections.
